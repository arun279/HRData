# Analysis on HRData

This repo consists of a basic analysis on the HR data created by IBM's Watson Analytics team.

Exploratory data analysis is performed.

Different models are fit to the data to compare the performance and see which gives the best accuracy.

A copy of the dataset is available in the repo. The original dataset can be found at: https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/

Just execute code.r file to run the analysis and get the results.

The final report document is a presentation created using Sharelatex's Beamer tool, gives an overview of my findings and recommendations based on the data.

Since this project was done for the fulfillment of project requirement of STA545 in the Biostatistics department of University at Buffalo, there is also a project proposal that needed to be submitted which I have made available here for reference to get an idea of the tasks that was proposed and delivered.
